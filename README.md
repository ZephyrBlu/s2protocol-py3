# s2protocol-py3
A Python 3 compatible version of Blizzards s2protocol library for parsing .SC2Replay files

Currently this works for me on Python 3.6.5

Things to be aware of:

- Dictionary strings of events are now byte strings

See: https://github.com/Blizzard/s2protocol for full documentation

This is already outdated as of 11/1/2019 since Blizzard has just released a new protocol.

I've also been informed it would be wiser to fork the original repo than create my own so I will be doing that in the coming days as well as probably adding the lib to PyPi.
